# Heimdall API

In the vast realms of the digital world, two domains existed side by side, separated by an invisible barrier. The chaotic and often treacherous realm was known as the Internet, a place full of countless wonders, but also home to numerous dangers and pitfalls. On the other side of the divide was the Intranet, a secure and efficient network built and used by citizens of the world to safeguard their data and internal systems.

To bridge these two domains and control the flow of information between them we need a watchful guardian. This guardian was designed to "see" and "hear" all incoming traffic to identify and neutralize potential threats before they could reach the internal network. The system was capable of distinguishing safe data requests from malicious ones. Heimdall also had a very important feature named "Gjallarhorn," named after the horn of the mythological watchman. Whenever a significant threat was identified, the Gjallarhorn function would acts as a loud horn heralding the approach of potential danger and start to react automagically.
